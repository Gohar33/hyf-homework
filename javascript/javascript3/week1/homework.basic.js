/* I decided to go with Harvar Museum API and request their API.
They have a broad collection to explore but I wanted
to focus on century collections and each century has its specific key code. So
I chose the code of 18th century and got the JSON data of their collection of
18th century art. The data is structured in strings and objects.Each object has a groupID and name.
